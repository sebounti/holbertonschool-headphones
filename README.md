Reproduce this web page from scratch, without any libraries. You'll use all the HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design skills you've learned previously.

You won't have many instructions, you're free to implement it however you like - the aim is simple: to have a fully functional web page that looks like the designer's file.

## Requirements

- you are not allowed to import external CSS framework (like Bootstrap)
- you are not to use Javascript
